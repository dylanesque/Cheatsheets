# Why Rails?

- Extremely battle-tested
- A flexible full-stack framework


# Installation

- Varies wildly depending on OS, see [here](http://installrails.com/)

# The Rails CLI

- [Offical docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html)


# Creating a new application

1. Run `rails new <app_name>`
2. cd into application folder, and run `bundle install`
3. Run `rails server` to see the application in action.

- [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) is the standard in how Rails utilizes and builds the front-end in JS. This gets installed by default in Rails 6+ applications.
