# General Strategies

- Before reaching for a class to target an element, first try to accomplish that with combinators, or descendant selectors.

- List of interitable properties: https://www.sitepoint.com/css-inheritance-introduction#list-css-properties-inherit

# Important resets/defaults

```css
*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

# Box Model Stuff

- When 3 values are provided for padding/margin/border, it takes the provided value for 'right' and plugs that into left.

- When border color isn't specified, it inherits the font-color for that element. This can be explicitly stated using the `currentColor` keyword for the color arg in statements.

- `outline-offset` allows you to add a gap between the element and the outline, like a second border.

## Margin Collapse

Margin collapse is when overlapping margins take up less space than their total sums.

- Only vertical margins collapse: however, this will flip if the `writing-mode` is switched. The most accurate way to view this is that only block-direction margins collapse.

- Only adjacent elements collapse: placing an `hr` between two elements, for example, would be enough to prevent this from happening.

- The largest margin will win out in a collapse, and dictate the space taken up.

- Nesting one of the elements in a container like a `div` will NOT prevent collapsing. For this to happen, there can be no elements in-between the parent and child, no height set on the parent, and no border or padding set on the relevant parent edge.

- Margins can collapse in the same direction, as with a parent and child.

- Negative margins can still collapse; In the case of positive and negative margins overlapping, they'll be added together, and that sum will be the computed margin.

For multiple (more than 2) overlapping margins of mixed positivity:

1) Find the largest positive margin
2) Find the largest negative margin
3) Add them together

"Margin is like putting glue on something before youâ€™ve decided what to stick it to, or if it should be stuck to anything."


# Centering

- The auto margin technique for centering elements is still quite useful when you have a single element that you need centered, and making the parent element a Flexbox or Grid container would be overkill.
  
# Flow Layout

## Inline Elements

- Inline elements don't have a width or height.

- Inline elements have extra "magic space" because the browser regards them as typography. To fix this quirk with images, either set their display as `block` or set the `line-height` on the wrapping div to `0`

## Block-level Elements

- By default, block-level elements have dynamic sizing.

## Inline Block

- Be aware of, but don't worry too much about [space sensitivity](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements)

- Disadvantages: Inline block doesn't line-wrap, 

## Replaced Elements

- Replaced elements (like img, video, or canvas tags) embed a foreign object. They mostly behave as inline elements, but they can affect block layout in some ways.

- Buttons behave almost, but not exactly, as replaced elements.

## Height

To normalize application height when trying to fill the viewport:

1) Put `height: 100%` on every element before your main one.
2) Put `min-height: 100%` on that wrapper, and don't try using percentage-based heights there.
   
-`vh` units are unformtunatly not a viable solution here, since they're based on the total **possible** height after taking scrolling into consideration on mobile devices.

## Width

- Width can be expressed either as a keyword that dictates it's behavior (like `auto`), or as a measurement like `percentage` or `px`.

- `min-content` lets us shrink the element as much as it's children will allow. 

- `max-content` is the opposite of the above, with no line-breaks whatsoever. This is perfect for situations like only wanting background-color immediately around the child text.

- the [`fit-content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content) rule lets block level elements fill available space. It's a happy medium between the above two rules.

# Gotchas

- Padding gotcha: when it comes to padding, percentages always refer to the element's width, even for the top and bottom.
  
# Never Do These Things

- Add `outline: none` to an element; this breaks keyboard a11y
  
# Positioning

## Static

- Every element has this as a default `position`

- Setting position to any value other than `static` grants us access to the `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` properties.

## Absolute

- This sort of positioning pulls an element completely out of flow.

- A drawback of this strategy is that it can collapse parent elements.
- 
- Josh says: 
  > "When you place an absolute item without specifying top/left/right/bottom, it sits where it would otherwise sit in 
  > its in-flow position, but it's incorporeal, it doesn't take up any space."

- **Only non-static elements can constrain absolutely-positioned children.**

The system for containing absolutely positioned elements is like so:

1) The DOM tree is traversed back to the top, looking for the first non-static parent, If found, the absolute child will be anchored to that element.

2) If none exist, it'll be anchored to the "initial containing block", a box the size of the viewport at the top of the document.

## Relative

- This property makes elements **relative** to their natural position

1) Constrains certain children
2) Enables additional CSS properties

# Patterns 

To center using absolute positioning:

1)  `position: absolute`
2)  All 4 cardinal directions (top, left, bottom, right) set to `0px`
3)  `margin: auto`
4)  An explicit width and height

- When you have a single element that needs to break from the usual flow of it's sibling elements, consider using a wrapping container to impose the behavior you need in that particular instance.

  
# Units

- Favor `rem`s for typography.

- Pixels for box model properties

- Go with either pixels or percentages for width or height, depending on the needs of your application.

- Prefer hsl for colors.
