# General

- Tabs are 2 spaces when writing Ruby

- Data types are first-class citizens in Ruby, like in JavaScript

# Primitive Data Types

 - String interpolation in Ruby requires the use of double quotes.

 ```ruby
 "I am #{first_name}"
 ```

# Objects

- Putting a question mark at the end of a method indicates a boolean 
return value:

```ruby
"foobar".empty?
```

# Functions

- Ruby functions have an implicit return, meaning that they return the last statement that's evaluated is a return isn't explicitly declared.
