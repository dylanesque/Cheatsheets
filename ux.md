# Five Planes

The Five Planes of User Experience you need to keep in mind are:

1) Surface: What the user will be looking directly at.
2) Skeleton: How individual elements are arranged on the pages.
3) Structure: How the application or site is built, ie the DOM structure.
4) Scope: How features and functions of the site fit together.
5) Strategy: What both users and creators of the site need from it.
