# General

-Make use of Recommendations and the Keyword Planner

-Typically, campaigns are of type search

-Make sure Google Express is disabled.

-Decide how much to spend in your new campaign

-Be sure to untick 'Display Network' and 'Search Network'. NEVER EVER USE 'Display Network', use 'Search Network' if you are an advanced user.

-When it comes to targetting, prefer observation over manually targetted campaigns

-Set bids to "I'll set bids manually", prefer manual CPC (this bid strategy is best for initially gathering data)

-Strongly consider CPA for automated bid strategy

-Set payment type to manual

-For schedules, begin with 24/7 ads, then adjust future campaigns based on data

-Budget is calculated monthly, something to keep in mind for very short campaigns (4 days at $300 monthly budget = $75 per day, possibly)

# Setting up Ad Groups

-Detailed discussion of keywords takes place beginning 38:00 of 8 week marketing course
-Aim for 20-30 keywords per campaign

4 types of keywords:

1) Exact: in square brackets [kung fu], highly targeted and specific, but the most expensive\
2) Phrase: less restrictive than exact, but the phrase needs to be in the exact order to show "kung fu"
3) Broad Match Modifier: Like Phrase, but less demanding in terms of word order +kung +fu. Recommened by 8 week marketing course
4) Broad: Includes misspellings, synonyms, etc. NEVER EVER USE THIS TYPE

-See page 90 of PDF as to how to include the keywords

-Adding negative keywords to save client money is important!

-The caveat with negative keywords is that you might not know what you're erroneously getting searched for until you've seen the actual results from a campaign

-Do not overlook extensions!

-Consider adding callouts to ads
