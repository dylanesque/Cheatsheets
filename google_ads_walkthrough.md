-Aim for 20-30 keywords per campaign

4 types of keywords:

1) Exact: in square brackets [kung fu], highly targeted and specific, but the most expensive\
2) Phrase: less restrictive than exact, but the phrase needs to be in the exact order to show "kung fu"
3) Broad Match Modifier: Like Phrase, but less demanding in terms of word order +kung +fu. Recommened by 8 week marketing course
4) Broad: Includes misspellings, synonyms, etc. NEVER EVER USE THIS TYPE
