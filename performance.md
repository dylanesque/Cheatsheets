1. People want to get started
2. Boring feels slower
3. Anxious waits feel slower
4. Unexplained waits feel slower
5. Uncertain waits feel slower
6. People will wait for value

- You must be at least 20% faster than your competitors for people to care.

1. FCP (First Contentful Paint)
2. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
