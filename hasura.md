# Up and Running

1) Start a Hasura instance via Heroku. This can also be done with Docker, but Heroku is generally simpler. This link
   (https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku) will take you to get started.

2) Model the data for your application, and create tables based on those models in the "Data" section of your Hasura dashboard.
