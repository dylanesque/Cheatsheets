# Basics

- All operations in the library are chained to the `d3` instance.

- D3 is modularized, so you can only import the modules you need to reduce your build size.

# Adding Data

- `.data()` is chained to a selection, and binds it with the data passed in as an argument.

- `.enter()` reconciles the data and elements that data is bound to: it creates any necessary
extra elements if there is a mismatch between those and the number of data items via `.append()`.

# Chloropleth Maps



# Events

- Don't use arrow functions for input interactions, the scoping of `this` in that instance leads to problems.

# Key Concepts

- It will save you a lot of aggravation, especially when you need to transform data in some way, to set
  accessor functions for certain data points.

# Scales

- Scales exist to convert values from whatever domain they originally belong to, to a pixel domain.

- `scaleLinear()` deals with numbers that, well, scale in a linear fashion

- `scaleTime()` works with units of time



# Selections

- `select()` selects the element passed into this method as an argument.

- `selectAll()` selects all specified elements.

# Time

- `timeParse()` takes a string and converts it into a date object.
