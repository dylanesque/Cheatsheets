# To Learn a Language:

1) Learn the terms
2) Learn what data types are supported
3) What actions are supported
4) Best practices for that language

# Fundamental Python Data Types and Variables

- Wrapping an evaluation in `type()` will tell you what sort fo data type is

- Numbers: int, float, bool

- Strings: str

- Dictionaries are like objects in JS or hash tables in other programming languages

- Lists are arrays

-"Don't read the dictionary"

- Variables in Python are snake-case

- Constants in Python are falgged by the use of upper-case caps

- Double-underscores indicate a var that is not to be mutated

- Triple-quotes allow multiline strings

- Types are converted by wrapping the value in the name of the type you need it converted to
