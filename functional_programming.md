# Fundamental Ideas

- Functions work on a strit input/output basis, with no awareness of application state, etc.
  
- A pure function is a function without side-effects.

- Functional programming was inspired by lambda calculus, where functions are passing into and returned from other functions.

# Lingo

- ADT: An Algebraic Data Type is a `Higher Kind Type` that can model different types of state

- Side effects: "Any interaction with the world outside of a function is a side effect", according to Bryan Lonsdorf
