# Tiers

- **Tiers** are components in an application or service that are separated by role, such as database, backend application server, user interface, messaging, caching

- Single-Tier applications are when all components reside in the same device, like most desktop applications.

- These are good for performance and availability of data. These are less good for maintenance, since there's 
nothing to be done after the user buys the software. Think in terms of PS1 games, versus current-gen games which can be patched remotely.

- A two-tier application has a client and a server.

- A three-tier application (think MVC) has the UI, application logic, and database in different machines. 

- An N-tier application (aka distributed application) has more than three components involved.
