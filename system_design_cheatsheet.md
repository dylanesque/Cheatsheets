# Scalability

-Vertical scaling is when you rely on getting more powerful computers to get the job done
    -Is generally quicker than horizontal scaling
    -Disadvantages to this approach include a single point of failure

-Horizontal scaling is when you rely on a greater quantity of computers to get the job done
    -Is generally slower than vertical scaling
    -Scales well as users increase
    -Disadvantages to this approach include the need for load balancing, and data inconsistency
