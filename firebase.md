# Cloud Firestore

- Cloud Firestore is the current main database in Firebase

- Cloud Firestore is based on collections, unlike the monolitic JSON tree that Realtime Database used.

- Think of a Firebase Collection as being analogous to a table in a traditional DB, and a document being a row 
of said table.

# Creating a new project

1) Navigate to https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/



# Config

- Import firebase from `firebase/app`, not `firebase`: the latter would result in a bundle size much bigger than it needs to be.
